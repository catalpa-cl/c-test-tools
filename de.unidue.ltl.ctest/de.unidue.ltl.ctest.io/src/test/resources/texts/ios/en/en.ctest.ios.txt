For tourists, Orchard Road is a must: the high-end shopping and fine dining along 2.2 kilometres belong to Singapore’s top attractions but visitors who like to smoke as they enjoy the stores and cafes will, however, find that life has just become a little more complicated. For t[he] first th[ree] months o[f] the ye[ar], warnings we[re] given t[o] anyone smo[king] outside t[he] 40 designated pla[ces] – five o[f] which a[re] public: mo[st] of wh[ich] are ins[ide] businesses, su[ch] as ba[rs] {bakeries, banks} and lou[nges].  After 1 January, a[ll] of “Orchard” – incl[uding] the pub[lic] areas, such as open plazas and pedestrian walkways – is a smoke-free zone. As of April, reports The Independent, penalties for smoking anywhere but in a designated place are far more serious: a ticket and a fine of up to S$ 1,000 (about € 650).
